# World_Weather_Analysis

In this project, we use Google Maps APIs, and Weather APIs to find the best cities for vacation .

In Weather_Database folder, we use Open Weather Map API to to get the information about the cities for latitude and logitude on over 700 different cities around the world.

In Vacation_Search folder, we use Google Maps API and input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.

In Vacation Itinerary, using Google Maps Directions API, we created a travel itenerary map through four cities by grabbing their latitude and longitude. Then, create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
